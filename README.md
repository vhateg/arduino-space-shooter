# arduino_space_shooter
Interesting game written for use with an Arduino and a 20x4 LCD<br>
This game was inspired by the Nokia Space Impact game, but is less complex because of limitations in how sprites are handled by the LCD controller<br>
## Components list
1. Arduino (I used a 8MHz Arduino Pro Mini clone, any AVR board should be fine)
2. 3× push buttons
3. 3× 10kΩ resistor
4. 3× 100kΩ resistor
5. 3× 100nF capacitor
6. 1× 10kΩ potentiometer<br>
The component values don't have to be exact, a little variation is Ok.<br>
